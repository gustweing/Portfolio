											<h2 id="content">1- year as Data Analyst</h2>
											<p>Build of data solution for the business problems to the cooperative.
												Huge knowledge with tools as SAS Guide, SQL, Python and Power BI to resolve the flagged problems. Was made two diferents projects until now:
												<ul>
													<li>Learning to Rank Project</li>
												Was developed a Machine Learning project - Linear Regression Model - to create a list of customers that would contract one product
												and was created a Dashboard in Power BI to the business team keep up with the main metrics and goals.
												In this project I was the responsable to the data minning and for the Power BI Dashboard, in addition to help the parameterize the Machine Learning Model.
												This project was made using SAS Guide, SQL, Python and Power BI.<br />
													<li>One Page View Project</li>
												Was criated two Dashboards for team follow-up. A montly and weekly One Page View Dashboard with all the main metrics for the business team. For this project have been used a database from all year of the
												company. All Dashboard was made in Power BI and made a connection with Denodo to collect the data.
												This project was made using SAS Guide, SQL, Denodo and Power BI.<br />
												</ul>

											<h2 id="content">2 complete projects of Data Science</h2>
											<p>Build of data solutions for business problems, close to the challenges inside a real company, using public data where was approach since the conception
												of the problem until the publication of the trained algotithm, using tools of cloud computing.</p>

											<h2 id="content">1+ year as technical budgeter</h2>
											<p>Study and analysis of budge technicals seeing the migration of customer to the Free Energy Market. Used to have direct contact with the customer since the prospection
												until the end of purchase stage. Have knowledge and experience in bidding to government agency or corporation. </p>

											<h3>Buy and Sell recommendation trying to maximize the profit.</h3>
											<p>Identify properties with low price and high potencial to resell properties and defining the value for them through the median of zip-code local.
												The result of this solution, if this would be implanted, would generate a profit of U$ 2.016.458.904,40. </p>

											<h3>Project of sales forecast with Machine Learning.</h3>
											<p>Accomplish a sales forecast of the next 6 weeks of a company for each one store. To execute this project was made a Machine Learning model using
												XGBoost to came into the result intended. In addition, was built an API to require directly to a Telegram's Bot where you pass a number of
												the store wished and the response will be the Sales Forecast for that one.</p>
